# eDiscovery Shift 
Core eDiscovery (E3) to Advanced eDiscovery (E5) Migration Tool

## Overview
Today, customers have no direct pathway to migrate their eDiscovery cases from [Core eDiscovery (E3)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/get-started-core-ediscovery?view=o365-worldwide) to [Advanced eDiscovery (E5)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/overview-ediscovery-20?view=o365-worldwide#subscriptions-and-licensing). 

The eDiscovery Shift tool will mitigate the overhead of a manual case migration by providing customers with an automated migration solution. After migrating existing core eDiscovery (CED) cases into Advanced eDiscovery (AED), customers are able to take advantage of the additional features available in the advanced solution. 

## Objective
At the current time, historical and ongoing eDiscovery cases created in the Core eDiscovery solution are not automatically available in the Advanced eDiscovery solution. The process required to upgrade cases from the Microsoft 365 Core eDiscovery solution into the Advanced eDiscovery solution requires multiple manual interventions. 

The eDiscovery Shift tool provides you with:
- <b>Automation:</b> Case settings, hold policies and searches are copied from the core eDiscovery case into a newly created Advanced eDiscovery case. 
- <b>Minimize case management overhead:</b> eDiscovery Administrators are now able to migrate all ongoing cases from CeD into AeD directly, minimizing overhead of managing multiple eDiscovery solutions. 
- <b>GUI-based tool:</b> Easily use tool GUI to migrate the cases without requirement for technical expertise with PowerShell scripts and/or Microsoftâ€™s Graph API.


### How does eDiscovery Shift work?

1. Creates a new Advanced eDiscovery case.
2. Migrates core eDiscovery case details and holds. 
3. Generate migration status report including any failures.
4. Release the holds from old cases (Coming Soon)
5. Delete old Core eDiscovery cases (Coming Soon)
